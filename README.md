# SpaSNE

As an extension of the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), the 
spatially resolved t-SNE (SpaSNE) was designed to preserve both the global gene 
expression and the spatial structure for the spatially resolved profiling data. 
By leveraging both the gene expression and the spatial information, SpaSNE gives
a comprehensive low-dimensional visualization that could best reflect the 
molecular similarities of cells and the spatial interactions between cells.  

Paper: Dimensionality reduction for visualizing spatially resolved profiling 
        data using SpaSNE.

# Result

Below is an example of the SpaSNE visualization for the mouse visual Cortex 
data.

𝑟1: Pearson correlation coefficient between pairwise Euclidean gene expression 
    distances and embedding distances of points, which was used to measure 
    gene expression preservation. 

𝑟2: Pearson correlation coefficient between pairwise spatial position distances 
    and embedding distances of points, which was used to measure spatial 
    structure preservation.
    
# Environment setup and code compilation

__Download the package__

The package can be downloaded by running the following command in the terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Lin-Xu-lab/SpaSNE.git
```
Then,
```
cd SpaSNE
```
to access the downloaded folder. 

__Compilation__

The package has been successuflly tested in an environment of python version 
3.8.8, pandas version 1.3.4, and g++ version 11.2.0. Assumpting you have already
set up the above environment, please run the following command in the terminal to
generate the "spasne" executable file.
```
gmake
```
Please see the Makefile for other commands.

If you do have have the environment, please follow the instructions in 
__Environment setup__ to set up the environment. 

__Environment setup__

The package may also work for the environment of your machine. However, if you 
find the code get stuck there, we recommend you to set up the environment as the 
same with our successful test. An option to set up the environment is to use 
Conda 
(https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

You can use the following command to create an environment for SpaSNE:
```
conda create -n myenv python=3.8.8 pandas=1.3.4
```

After the environment is created, you can use the following command to activate 
it:
```
conda activate myenv
```

Please install Jupyter Notebook from https://jupyter.org/install. For example, 
you can run
```
pip install notebook
```
in the terminal to install the classic Jupyter Notebook. 

The *.cpp files need g++ to compile. The code has been successfully tested under
g++ version 11.2.0. If your g++ version cannot successfully compile the code, 
please visit https://gcc.gnu.org/ to download the GCC 11.2. 

After you set up the environment, please follow the instructions in 
__Compilation__ to generate the "spasne" executable file. 

__Import spasne in other folders__

If you would like to import spasne in other folders, there is an option to
make it work. Please run
```
python setup.py install --user &> log
```
in the terminal and then use
```
grep Installed log
```
to obtain the path that the SpaSNE software is installed. You will see something
like 
"Installed /home/chentang/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/spasne-1.0-py3.8.egg"

You need to copy the "spasne" executable file generated by running "gmake" in 
the terminal to the folder that the software is installed:
```
cp spasne /home/chentang/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/spasne-1.0-py3.8.egg/
```
Note, in the command above, please use your installed path to replace mine. 

After doing these successfully, you are supposed to be able to import spasne 
when you are using Python or Jupyter Notebook in other folders:
```
import spasne
```

# Parameter setting

SpaSNE has two key parameters: The global gene expression weight 𝛼 that balances 
the prevervations of local and global gene expressions, and the spatial weight 𝛽 
that balances gene expressions and the spatial structure. A larger 𝛼 leads to a 
larger 𝑟1 and a smaller 𝑟2, while a larger 𝛽 leads to a larger 𝑟2 and a smaller 
𝑟1. Thus, a proper ratio between 𝛼 and 𝛽 is required to give a satisfied 
preservation of both the gene expressions and the spatial structure. We give the 
following recommendations for setting 𝛼 and 𝛽:  

𝛼 ∈ [5,15], 𝛽 ∈ [1,7.5], and 𝛼 / 𝛽 ≥ 2. 

When the random seed is variable or not set, a large 𝛼 may result in a large 
chance of embedding failure, especially for small (spatial samples) datasets. 
For example, for the BreastCancer1272 dataset used as an example in this 
software package, there was a higher chance of embedding failure when setting 𝛼 
to 12 than setting it to 10 (𝛽 was also changed accordingly based on an 𝛼 / 𝛽 
ratio). Therefore, for small datasets, it might be relatively stable when 
setting 𝛼 not larger than 10. 

In this software package, the default parameters have been set as (𝛼 = 8, 𝛽 = 2)
when the input of the spatial information is available, and (𝛼 = 8, 𝛽 = 0) when 
there is no input of the sptial information. 

Please see the spasne.py file for the introduction of more parameters. 

# Examples
